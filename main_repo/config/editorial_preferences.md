# Bangladesh Data Content Platform — Editorial Rules & Content Policy
# Version: 1.0 | Last Updated: February 2026
#
# PURPOSE: All agents (Strategist, Researcher, Writer, Fact-Checker) MUST
# load this file. These rules define what content we create, what we avoid,
# and how we handle sensitive situations. Non-negotiable.

## 1. CORE EDITORIAL PHILOSOPHY

### The Mission
Present data-driven stories about Bangladesh's political, economic, and social trajectory in a way that is:
- **Strictly factual** — every claim is sourced and verifiable
- **Genuinely neutral** — no party, ideology, or era is praised or blamed
- **Accessible** — complex statistics translated into human stories
- **Trustworthy** — when data is uncertain, we say so

### The One Rule That Overrides Everything
> If a piece of content cannot be published without a credible, verifiable source, it does not get published.

Trust is the product. A single uncited or wrong statistic destroys credibility that takes months to build.

## 2. CONTENT CATEGORIES (What We Cover)

### Tier 1 — Core Topics (Highest Priority, Produce Frequently)
These topics always have government data available and are directly in our mission:

| Category | Example Topics |
|---|---|
| **Economic Indicators** | GDP growth, inflation, export earnings, remittance, foreign reserves |
| **Education** | Budget allocation, enrollment rates, literacy rate, dropout rates |
| **Healthcare** | Health spending, life expectancy, maternal mortality, vaccination coverage |
| **Infrastructure** | Road network expansion, electricity access, internet penetration, bridge/port projects |
| **Poverty & Inequality** | Poverty headcount ratio, Gini coefficient, income distribution |
| **Employment** | Unemployment rate, labor force participation, youth employment, garment sector |

### Tier 2 — Secondary Topics (Produce When Strong Data Available)

| Category | Example Topics |
|---|---|
| **International Rankings** | HDI ranking, Ease of Doing Business, Press Freedom Index, Corruption Perceptions |
| **Regional Comparisons** | Bangladesh vs SAARC neighbors on key metrics |
| **Fiscal Policy** | National budget breakdown, tax-to-GDP ratio, public debt |
| **Social Indicators** | Gender parity index, child marriage rate, nutrition data |
| **Environment** | Climate vulnerability rankings, air quality, river pollution metrics |
| **Trade** | Export diversification, import composition, trade balance |

### Tier 3 — Occasional Coverage (Only When Exceptional Data Available)

| Category | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Historical Milestones** | Liberation War economic data, post-independence growth story |
| **Policy Outcomes** | Specific programs with measurable, third-party verified outcomes |
| **Audience Questions** | When audience asks a data-answerable question |

---

## 3. WHAT WE DO NOT COVER (Hard Rules)

### Absolute Prohibitions — Never, Under Any Circumstances

| Prohibited Topic | Why |
|---|---|
| Active court cases / ongoing legal proceedings | Cannot comment on sub-judice matters |
| Personal lives of politicians or public figures | We cover data, not people |
| Religious controversies or sectarian tensions | Outside our mission; high risk of harm |
| Unverified allegations or rumors | No source = no publication |
| Speculation about future elections | Inherently partisan |
| Content that identifies or targets specific individuals | Privacy and safety concern |
| Any content that could incite communal tension | Zero tolerance |

### Soft Prohibitions — Avoid Unless Exceptional Circumstances

| Topic | Why Avoid | Exception |
|---|---|---|
| Active political controversies (ongoing protests, political arrests) | Too high-risk for misinterpretation | Only if 3rd-party data (not media reports) available |
| Topics with no verifiable government or international data | We can't fact-check opinion | Only if a recognized research institution (BRAC, CPD) has published findings |
| Very recent events (< 2 weeks old) | Data not yet settled or verified | Only if official government data already published |
| Content comparing leadership or personalities | Veers into personality politics | Stick to policy outcomes with data |

## 4. POLITICAL NEUTRALITY RULES

This is the most critical section. Read carefully.

### The Core Rule
**We compare eras (time periods), not parties or leaders.**

When comparing government periods:
- Always refer to them by year range: "1991–1996", "1996–2001", "2009–2024"
- Never name parties or leaders as the subject of success or failure
- The data tells the story; we do not editorialize on why

### Approved Framing
```
GOOD: "শিক্ষা বাজেট ১৯৯৬-২০০১ সময়কালে GDP-র ২.১% ছিল। ২০০৯-২০২৪ সময়কালে এটি ২.৫%-এ উন্নীত হয়েছে।"

BAD:  "[Party X] শাসনামলে শিক্ষা বাজেট বৃদ্ধি পেয়েছে, কিন্তু [Party Y]-এর সময় তুলনামূলক কম ছিল।"
```

### Credit and Blame
- Never attribute progress or failure to a specific party or leader
- If the data shows improvement: present it as "improvement was recorded" not "[X] achieved"
- If the data shows decline: present it as "a decline was recorded" not "[X] failed"
- If questioned by audience: "আমরা তথ্য উপস্থাপন করি, ব্যাখ্যা দর্শকদের জন্য ছেড়ে দিই।"

### Balanced Time Coverage
- Over any given month, coverage should span multiple government periods
- Do not disproportionately cover one era positively or negatively
- If a metric improved in one era and declined in another, show both clearly

---

## 5. DATA QUALITY STANDARDS

### Minimum Bar for Publication
A data point can only be used in content if it meets ALL of the following:

- [ ] Source is Tier 1 or Tier 2 (see `source_priority.md`)
- [ ] Source URL or document title is recorded
- [ ] Data was published by the source within the last 5 years (or is clearly historical)
- [ ] If the source is a government portal, cross-referenced with at least one independent source
- [ ] Methodology is understood (e.g., what does "poverty headcount" mean in BBS context?)

### Uncertainty Disclosure (Mandatory)
When data quality is lower than ideal, explicitly state it in the post:
- "BBS-এর ডেটায় ১৯৯৮-২০০০ সালের তথ্য পাওয়া যায়নি, তাই World Bank interpolation ব্যবহার করা হয়েছে।"
- "এই তথ্যটি estimate-ভিত্তিক, exact figure verify করতে পারিনি।"

Audiences respect honesty. Never hide data limitations.

### Confidence Levels
| Level | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **High** | Verified against primary Tier 1 source, direct match | Publish normally |
| **Medium** | Verified against Tier 2 source, or Tier 1 with minor gaps | Publish with note |
| **Low** | Single source, cannot cross-reference | Do not publish; flag for human review |
| **Unverified** | No credible source found | Do not publish, period |

---

## 6. SENSITIVITY FLAGS

When any of these conditions are present, **automatically escalate to human review** regardless of quality scores:

| Flag | Condition |
|---|---|
| 🚨 **High political sensitivity** | Content covers a period within 6 months of a major political event (election, coup, major protest) |
| 🚨 **Contradicts official narrative** | Data shows a result that significantly contradicts official government statements |
| 🚨 **Naming a living public figure** | Any content that could be read as criticizing a named, living politician |
| 🚨 **Religious or ethnic dimension** | Any data that could be read as favoring or disfavoring a religious or ethnic group |
| 🚨 **Source is disputed** | The data source itself is subject to credibility questions |
| 🚨 **No cross-reference possible** | Only one source exists for a key claim |

## 7. TOPIC IDEA GENERATION RULES (For Content Strategist Agent)

When the Strategist Agent generates weekly topic suggestions, it must follow these filters:

### Include Ideas That...
- Have verifiable data from at least one Tier 1 or Tier 2 source
- Cover a topic relevant to Bangladesh's trajectory (economic, social, infrastructure)
- Can be framed without triggering any sensitivity flag
- Are timely (connected to recent data release, anniversary, or current event — but not breaking news)
- Appeal to a young (18-35) Bangladeshi audience trying to understand their country

### Reject Ideas That...
- Have no verifiable data available
- Require naming political parties as subjects of success/failure
- Cover any absolute prohibition topic (Section 3)
- Are purely opinion-based (no statistics possible)
- Are too niche or technical for a general social media audience

### Weekly Idea Mix Target
| Category | Target Share |
|---|---|
| Economics / Finance | 25-30% |
| Education | 15-20% |
| Healthcare / Social | 15-20% |
| Infrastructure | 10-15% |
| International Comparisons | 10-15% |
| Historical / Timeline | 10-15% |

## 8. HUMAN ESCALATION TRIGGERS

The pipeline must automatically pause and notify the human operator when:

1. Any sensitivity flag (Section 6) is triggered
2. Fact-check confidence score falls below 90%
3. No Tier 1 or Tier 2 source found for a key claim
4. Content writer fails style check after 2 retries
5. Research agent cannot find any data after trying all fallback sources
6. A topic has been in "data unavailable" status for more than 7 days

---

## 9. CONTENT VOICE — WHAT WE ARE AND ARE NOT

| We Are | We Are Not |
|---|---|
| A data storytelling platform | A news outlet |
| Politically neutral | Politically "balanced" (we don't need to include political commentary to seem fair — data is fair by itself) |
| Educating our audience | Telling our audience what to think |
| Transparent about uncertainty | Selective about inconvenient facts |
| Long-term reputation builders | Chasing viral moments |
