# PURPOSE: The Research Agent and Fact-Checker Agent MUST use this file
# to determine which sources to trust, in what order to try them, and
# how to handle conflicts between sources.

## 1. SOURCE TIER SYSTEM

Sources are ranked in three tiers. Always try Tier 1 first. Use Tier 2 to
cross-reference or as fallback. Use Tier 3 only for context, never as the
sole source for a numerical claim.

---

## 4. TIER 3 — REFERENCE SOURCES (Context Only, Never Sole Source)

These sources can provide context, quotes, and help understand current events.
They must NEVER be the sole source for a numerical claim in a published post.

### Bangladesh News Media
| Outlet | URL | Use For |
|---|---|---|
| The Daily Star | https://www.thedailystar.net | Context, event background |
| Prothom Alo | https://www.prothomalo.com | Bangla-language context |
| The Financial Express (BD) | https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd | Economic news context |
| Dhaka Tribune | https://www.dhakatribune.com | News context |
| New Age Bangladesh | https://www.newagebd.net | News context |

### Research Institutions (Bangladesh)
| Institution | URL | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) | https://cpd.org.bd | Independent economic research |
| Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) | https://bids.org.bd | Academic economic research |
| Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC) | https://pprc.org | Poverty, social development |
| BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD) | https://bigd.bracu.ac.bd | Governance, development |

**Using Research Institution Data:** These institutions often produce their own surveys and research. Their data may be used at the same trust level as Tier 2 if:
- The methodology is clearly described
- The sample size is disclosed
- The publication is peer-reviewed or publicly available for scrutiny

### International Media (For Context Only)
- Reuters, Bloomberg, Financial Times — for global context on Bangladesh economy
- Never use as the source for Bangladesh-specific statistics (they themselves cite BBS/World Bank)

## 5. SOURCE CONFLICT RESOLUTION

When two sources give different numbers for the same metric, follow this protocol:

### Step 1: Check if they're measuring the same thing
Different sources sometimes measure different things with the same label.
Example: "poverty rate" — BBS uses its own methodology; World Bank uses $2.15/day line.
If measuring different things: **use both, explain the difference**.

### Step 2: Check the time period
One source may be using a different reference year.
If time periods differ: **cite both with their respective years**.

### Step 3: Apply tier priority
If genuinely the same metric and same year:
1. Prefer Tier 1 (BBS, Bangladesh Bank) for Bangladesh-specific data
2. Prefer World Bank / IMF for GDP, macroeconomic indicators (their methodology is more consistent for international comparison)
3. Prefer UNESCO for education metrics

### Step 4: Disclose the discrepancy
If a discrepancy cannot be resolved cleanly, disclose it in the post:
> "BBS-এর হিসাবে এই সংখ্যা X, তবে World Bank-এর data অনুযায়ী Y — পার্থক্যটি methodology-র কারণে।"

### Step 5: Escalate if discrepancy is large
If two Tier 1 or Tier 2 sources disagree by more than 15% on the same metric/year, flag for human review before publishing.

## 6. DEAD LINKS & DATA ACCESS ISSUES

Government portal websites (especially BBS) are sometimes slow, down, or reorganized.
Follow this fallback sequence:

1. Try the primary URL first
2. Try the Google Cache or Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) for the same URL
3. Try the World Bank version of the same data (they often republish BBS data)
4. If PDF is needed, try searching: `site:bbs.gov.bd [publication name] filetype:pdf`
5. If all fail: mark data as "source temporarily unavailable" and flag for human review

---

## 7. HOW TO CITE IN POSTS

Every post must include a citation. Use this format:

**Inline (within post body):**
> "GDP-র ২.১% (UNESCO, ২০২৩)"

**Source line (at end of every post):**
> 📊 Source: [Institution Name], [Publication/Dataset Name], [Year] | [URL or "Full link in bio"]

**Multiple sources:**
> 📊 Sources: BBS (Statistical Yearbook 2023) | World Bank Open Data | UNESCO UIS

Never omit the source line. Even if the URL is long, write "Full source link in bio" and include the actual URL in the Google Sheet content record.

---

## 8. SOURCES WE DO NOT USE

| Source Type | Why Not |
|---|---|
| Anonymous social media posts | Unverifiable |
| Political party websites / press releases | Partisan, unverified |
| Wikipedia (as primary source) | Can be edited; use Wikipedia's cited sources instead |
| Personal blogs | No institutional accountability |
| Paywalled reports we cannot access | Cannot verify full methodology |
| Any source that itself cites "anonymous sources" for statistics | Circular, unverifiable |
