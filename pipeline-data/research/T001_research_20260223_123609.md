## Research Summary
The research successfully found time-series data for Bangladesh's government expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP and primary school enrollment rates from the World Bank, which sources its data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS). The data spans from the early 1990s to 2023, allowing for a comparison across different government periods. However, there are some gaps in the early 1990s for education spending. The primary school enrollment data is more complete. The confidence is Medium-High because the data comes from a reliable Tier-2 source (World Bank/UNESCO), but direct Tier-1 BBS data for the entire period was not located in a consolidated format.

## Source Conflicts & Discrepancies
No significant conflicts were found between major international sources. The World Bank and UNESCO data are aligned, as the former uses the latter as its primary source for this indicator. Some news articles or local reports might cite slightly different figures based on national budget documents (which may use different fiscal year calculations vs. calendar year), but for international comparison, the UNESCO/World Bank data is the standard.

## Data Gaps & Missing Information
- **Education Spending (% of GDP):** Data for the years 1991-1994 and 1997 is missing from the World Bank/UNESCO dataset. This makes calculating a precise average for the 1991-1996 period difficult.
- **Recent Data:** Data for 2024 is not yet available for any of the indicators. The most recent education spending data is for 2023, and for enrollment, it is 2021.
- **BBS Data:** A consolidated, time-series dataset from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) website was not immediately discoverable through web searches, which is a common challenge. The international sources are often easier to query for historical data.

---

## Human Review Flags
- **Data Gaps in 90s:** The content writer should be aware of the missing data for education spending in the early 1990s and should frame any comparisons of that period carefully, noting that the average is based on incomplete data.
- **Era vs. Party:** The final content must adhere to the editorial guideline of comparing eras (e.g., "1996-2001") rather than political parties or leaders.

## Recommended Content Angle
1.  **The Two-Decade Story of Primary Education:** A timeline showing how primary school net enrollment rose dramatically from ~76% in 1991 to over 97% by 2015, where it has since stabilized. This is a major success story supported by data.
2.  **A Look at Education Investment:** A chart showing the education spending as a percentage of GDP over time. The data shows it has fluctuated, often hovering around 2%, and rarely exceeding 2.5%. This can be presented neutrally, comparing the figures across different five-year periods without assigning credit or blame.
