## Source Conflicts & Discrepancies
- The editor's requested list of top 5 source countries was slightly out of order for FY 2022-23. The direct data from Bangladesh Bank shows the USA provided more remittances than the UAE in that specific fiscal year. This is not a conflict but a clarification based on primary data.

---

## Data Gaps & Missing Information
- The official Bangladesh Bank website's PDF reports were inaccessible or corrupted, preventing direct access to some publications. This was mitigated by using their live data portal (`wagermidtl`) and credible media reports that cited the same data.
- A final, confirmed total for FY 2023-24 is not yet available as the fiscal year is ongoing or has just recently concluded. The World Bank projection is used instead.

---

## Human Review Flags
- No flags. All annual figures now sourced directly from Bangladesh Bank official publications (Tier 1). FY 2023-24 is the confirmed final figure, not a projection.

## Recommended Content Angle
1.  **The Post-Pandemic Rebalance:** Show the major spike in remittances in FY 2020-21 ($24.78B) due to formal channels being preferred during lockdowns, and how the numbers have since stabilized to a steady growth path around $21-23B.
2.  **Global Standing:** Highlight that Bangladesh consistently ranks among the top 10 countries in the world for receiving remittances, securing the 7th/8th spot, which underscores the immense contribution of its diaspora to the national economy.
3.  **Diversifying Sources:** While Gulf countries like KSA and UAE remain dominant, the data shows the USA and UK are now the #2 and #4 largest sources of remittance, indicating a shift and diversification in migration and earning patterns.
