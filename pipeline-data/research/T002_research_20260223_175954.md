## Research Summary
This research compiles inflation data for Bangladesh and its South Asian neighbors (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal) for the period 2022-2024. The primary sources are the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which provide consistent annual average data suitable for cross-country comparison. Bangladesh Bank data, sourced from BBS, provides more recent monthly figures for Bangladesh specifically. Data for 2022 and 2023 is firm, while 2024 figures are largely projections from the IMF's World Economic Outlook. A key finding is that while all countries experienced inflationary pressure, the severity and trajectory varied significantly, with Sri Lanka and Pakistan facing exceptionally high rates.

## Source Conflicts & Discrepancies
- **Annual Average vs. Point-to-Point:** A key potential point of confusion is the difference between annual average inflation (used by IMF/World Bank for yearly comparisons) and point-to-point inflation (reported monthly by Bangladesh Bank/BBS). The annual average smooths out monthly volatility. For this report, annual averages are used for cross-country comparison, while the BB data is included for recent domestic context. No direct conflict was found, but the methodologies are different and should be noted.
- **Minor Statista vs. IMF/WB differences:** Some sources like Statista show slightly different figures (e.g., 9.02% for Bangladesh in 2023 vs. World Bank's 9.48%). This is likely due to different data update cycles or minor methodological adjustments. The IMF/World Bank figures are preferred as they are the primary source for international macroeconomic data and ensure consistency across countries.

## Data Gaps & Missing Information
- **Food Inflation Breakdown:** While the editor requested a focus on food inflation, finding consistent, comparable annual average food inflation data for all five countries from a single Tier 1 or Tier 2 source proved difficult. The World Bank's main data portal provides overall CPI, not a specific food CPI breakdown. While news articles mention food inflation figures for specific months, a consistent time-series for 2022-2024 was not readily available for all countries in the scope of this research. This would require a deeper dive into each country's national statistics office database, which is beyond the current task's scope.
- **2024 Final Data:** All figures for 2024 are projections from the IMF's World Economic Outlook. Final, verified annual data for 2024 will not be available from the World Bank or IMF until mid-to-late 2025.

## Human Review Flags
- 🚨 **Contradicts Official Narrative (Potential):** The data shows Bangladesh's inflation in 2023 (9.48%) was higher than India's (5.4%) and the regional average (6.38%). This contrasts with narratives that might focus solely on the extreme cases of Pakistan and Sri Lanka to downplay domestic price pressures. The content must be framed neutrally to present these facts without assigning blame.
- 🚨 **Source is Disputed (Minor):** While the IMF and World Bank are Tier 2 gold standards, domestic entities sometimes dispute their projections. It's crucial to label the 2024 data clearly as "IMF Projections."

## Recommended Content Angle
1.  **Comparative Snapshot:** Create a visual (bar chart) comparing the 2023 annual inflation rates for the five countries (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal). The key message would be showing the spectrum of inflation in the region, with Bangladesh positioned between the relative stability of India/Nepal and the hyperinflationary pressures in Pakistan/Sri Lanka.
2.  **Trend Story (2022-2024):** A line chart showing the inflation trend for each country from 2022 to 2024 (projected). This angle would highlight how Sri Lanka's inflation is rapidly decreasing from a high peak, Pakistan's remains stubbornly high, and Bangladesh's peaked in 2023 with a projected decline in 2024. This tells a story of divergent recoveries from the global price shocks.
