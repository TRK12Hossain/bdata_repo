- Claims for FY 2019-20, FY 2020-21, and FY 2023-24 were verified against a combination of the Bangladesh Bank's live data portal and highly reliable secondary sources (Wikipedia's compilation of BB data, major news outlets) which all corroborated the figures in the draft.
- All other claims were verified directly from the cited sources. No discrepancies were found. The draft is factually accurate.
